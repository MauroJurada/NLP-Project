In 2007 the majority of the world-wide population became urban [1], and, by 2050, this percentage will continue growing reaching 66% [2], entailing further urbanization [3]—one of the major anthropogenic contributors to climate change [4]—and the potential raise of local warming phenomena: Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect [5]. This latter, in turn, augments cooling energy demand [6–12] and the related Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that feed-back climate change. Nowadays, the building sector is responsible for the use of almost 120 EJ globally and about 30% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions [13]. As in the EU28, between 1990 and 2013, the energy-use in the household sector dropped by just 3.2% [14], a further amelioration of the building sector is mandatory to diminish energy use, contributing to climate stabilization. 
Among other mitigation and adaptation strategies [15–18], green infrastructures can contribute to urban wastewater management [19,20] and to mitigate urban temperature [5,21–24]. Since in densely urbanized cities residual surfaces convertible into vegetated areas are rarely available, rooftops can provide unexploited urban surfaces [25,26] that can help climate adaptation and mitigation. As, in the last decades, the interest towards climate change mitigation and urban climate resilience is growing, green roofs are gaining importance and a wide body of research has been published to ameliorate their performances and to investigate their benefits in different climates (e.g., Refs. [27–31]). 
Green  roofs can be mainly clustered into extensive and intensive. Extensive green roofs are usually more economically affordable than intensive green ones and because of their lightweight—typically the growing medium layer is 5–15 cm—they can retrofit existing rooftops [32–34]. Because of their easy installation, green roofs mounted on modular trays are becoming popular, although, they cannot be used for pedestrians or for recreational purposes because of their limited structural resistance. Typically, green roofs are constituted—from top to bottom—by: vegetation layer, growing medium, waterproofing membrane, and insulation layer [35]. Additional layers to their basic configuration are a root barrier and a drainage layer [36]. Usually, growing medium is an artificial light substrate and plants are succulent species because of their resistance, minimal maintenance, and limited or unnecessary irrigation [36,37]. Intensive green roofs, also called roof gardens, are characterized by a 15–120 cm thick growing medium that permits to shrubs, little trees, large plants or lawns to grow, providing urban amenities and recreational areas [35,38]. Because of their weight, intensive green roofs can be exclusively installed on specifically designed flat rooftops. The environmental benefits provided by intensive green roofs are the same or greater than extensive roofs, but the maintenance and irrigation costs are higher [39]. 
Initial and management costs make green roof wide-deployment unattractive, especially in hot climates, where irrigation is crucial in decreasing cooling loads [40–43], and watering costs can exceed the economic benefits deriving from the decrease in building energy demand. 
Green  roof installation can be beneficial both at building and urban scale as it can: contribute to energy-saving (e.g., Refs. [44–50]); decrease thermal oscillations on the rooftop surface that, in turn, can prolong the lifespan of the rooftop membrane [36,51,52]; abate noise [53,54], enhance air quality [55–59], contribute to beautification [35], enhance urban biodiversity [58–60], reduce storm water runoff [61–72], and mitigate UHI [73–75].
