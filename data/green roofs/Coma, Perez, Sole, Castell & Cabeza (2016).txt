During the last two decades , the building sector has experienced an important evolution in terms of quantity of constructed buildings, but less evolution in its energy performance regarding to usage and operational phases. Consequently, 40% of total primary energy consumption in European Union (EU) is due to households and the building sector. For this reason and with the aim to reduce the CO2 emissions, the EU has issued legislations and regulations on energy efficiency of buildings [1] and built environment sustainability [2,3]. Therefore, in the building sector reduction of both energy demand and environmental impact have become important factors to achieve more sustainable buildings and meet the objectives of “20e20e20” in energy efficiency. In addition, the European Energy Directives promote new building processes and construction systems to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in buildings. 
New construction systems have become important for the scientific community in the last decade. Within them, green roofs are seen as interesting construction systems because they provide both aesthetic and environmental benefits [4], being one of them energy savings. 
Numerous  studies in different fields about green roofs have been conducted during the last twenty years. Some authors divide these systems into two categories, “extensive” and “intensive” [5e8], while other authors introduce an intermediate category called “semi-intensive” green roofs, which are a combination of the extensive and intensive [9]. Generally, extensive green roofs have shallower substrates (<200 mm) that do not represent an excessive overweight for conventional roof structures (70e170 kg/m2) [8]. Some advantages are: no additional structural reinforcements, less investment in growing media and plants, and less maintenance. On the other hand, intensive green roofs systems, also called living roofs or roof gardens, implement more heavy vegetation, like trees and shrubs, which require deeper substrates (>200 mm). In addition, roof gardens represent an overweight (290e970 kg/m2) and additional maintenance in plant care [8]. These systems are focused on landscape and aesthetic values to increase living and recreation spaces in densely populated urban areas [7]. 
After literature review, the main environmental benefits of these systems compared to the traditional flat roofs have been found and listed below: water retention capacity [10e12], reduction of surface runoff in large cities [13,14], water runoff quality [14,15], improvement of urban environment, mitigating the Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) [16e18], reduction of CO2 concentration in the urban environment [19,20], sound absorption [21,22], enhance of internal membranes durability [23,24], aesthetics reactions [25], and enhancement of the biodiversity and reduction of habitat losses [26]. 
In addition to all the above mentioned advantages, it is known that green roofs are efficient systems to reduce the indooreoutdoor temperature variations and, consequently, to decrease the annual energy consumption [24,27]. However , there are different parameters which influence the final energy performance of a green roof that can be experimentally studied more in detail, such as building insulation characteristics, the climate zone, plant types (Leaf Area Index, stomatal resistance, height, fractional coverage and albedo) [28e30], growing media (thickness, composition, density, moisture content) [28,30,31], and drainage layer properties [28,32,33].
