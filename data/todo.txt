Maybe ‘ecosystem services’
Yes this might work
There are four of them and they are always described just like the green roof thing

regulating services, provisioning services, supporting and cultural ecosystem services
You’ll have to google scholar ‘ecosystem services’ and look for the distinction and description if them
