Green roofs are emerging as one of the most promising management practices aiming to ameliorate the environmental problems and hydrological risks associated with urbanization (Booth and Jackson, 1997; Carbone et al., 2014, 2015; Hilten et al., 2008). One of the most important services provided by green roof systems is related to their ability to retain a portion of the rainfall and to distribute runoff over a longer period of time. In this way, green roofs are considered as an effective methodology for reducing hydrological risks in urban regions. 
Green roof systems typically consist of three major components: a vegetation layer, a lightweight substrate medium and a water storage/drainage layer placed on top of a waterproof membrane (Carbone et al., 2015; Carson et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). According to the depth of the growing substrate layer, green roofs are commonly classified as extensive or intensive. Generally, green roofs with substrate depth less than 15 cm are classified as extensive and their vegetation consists of shallow rooting, drought resistant plants. In contrast, intensive green roofs have a substrate depth exceeding 15 cm which can support the sustainable growth of deeper rooting plants such as shrubs and trees. Due to the above mentioned characteristics, extensive green roofs are lighter, cheaper, and require less maintenance. Accordingly, they have wider applicability, especially on older building retrofitting where rooftop weight is the outmost limiting factor (Carson et al., 2013; Nektarios et al., 2011, 2015; Yang et al., 2015). 
The hydrologic performance of green roof systems is characterized by the rainfall depth retained and the runoff release rate. They both depend on several factors, such as rainfall specific characteristics, anteceded rainfall conditions, substrate depth and its hydraulic characteristics, storage/drainage layer capacity, vegetation cover characteristics, and slope of the green roof (Carbone et al., 2015; Speak et al., 2013; Teemusk and Mander, 2007; Wong and Jim, 2014). Several studies have reported that green roofs can retain up to 90% of the total rainfall depth when individual rainfall events are considered, with the observed retention being reduced as the rainfall depth increased (Carson et al., 2013; Carter and Rasmussen, 2006; Getter et al., 2007; Mentens et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2013; Simmons et al., 2008; Spolek, 2008; Stovin et al., 2012; Teemusk and Mander, 2007; Van Woert et al., 2005; Wong and Jim, 2014). Furthermore, reductions of 60â€“80% have been reported in peak flow rates from green roof systems compared with conventional roof tops (Bliss et al., 2009; Carter and Jackson, 2007; Palla et al., 2012; Villarreal et al., 2004). When the total annual rainfall depth is considered, green roofs may significantly reduce runoff generation from 15% to 80% (Bliss et al., 2009; Carter and Jackson, 2007; Palla et al., 2012; Villarreal et al., 2004). However, several studies showed that the observed retention depends on the rainfall pattern (Carter and Rasmussen, 2006; Teemusk and Mander, 2007; Wong and Jim, 2014). More specifically, in larger rainfall events, the maximum green roof storage capacity is reached, resulting in temporary retainment of the remaining rainfall which is then slowly released from the green roof system. Thus, the rainfall surge becomes significantly smoothed compared with the conventional impervious rooftops (Hilten et al., 2008; Wong and Jim, 2014). In addition, the ability of green roofs to reduce runoff is greatly affected by the initial moisture conditions as well as by the total rainfall depth. Consequently, the capacity of green roof systems to reduce runoff when it is mostly needed, namely during wet periods and for large rainfall events, has been questioned. 
In practice, water resources planning guidelines necessitate the use of simple methods for estimating runoff volumes and peak flows from green roof systems. For instance, existing regulations often demand hydrologic calculations to be performed using the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method (NRCS, 2009) or by utilizing the runoff coefficient of the rational method. Therefore, several researchers have studied the empirical relationships for green roof runoff based on curve number and runoff coefficient (Alfredo et al., 2010; Carter and Rasmussen, 2006; Fassman-Beck et al., 2016; Getter et al., 2007; Moran et al., 2005). Yang et al. (2015), analyzed the possible runoff generation mechanisms in green roofs, which involve either the runoff resulting from substrate saturation (saturation-excess) or runoff generated when the rainfall intensity is larger than the infiltration rate (infiltration-excess). They suggested that due to the highly conductive substrate materials that are utilized in extensive or semi-intensive green roofs, saturation-excess is the dominant mechanism. Accordingly, they proposed a simple linear relationship between total rainfall depth and total runoff depth based on a simple water balance applied on an event by event basis.
