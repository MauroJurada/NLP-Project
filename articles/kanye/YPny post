 
Kanye West — who claims to be running for president — gave an emotional speech about abortion, bashed famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman and boasted about his IQ during a bizarre campaign rally in South Carolina on Sunday.

The Chicago rapper wore a bulletproof vest and had the numbers “2020” shaved into his head as he  addressed the crowd, revealing that he and wife Kim Kardashian West considered terminating their first pregnancy — but didn’t after he had a “vision from God,” according to a livestream of the event.

He then began to cry hysterically as he said: “My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me.”

“I almost killed my daughter,” West, 43, continued in tears, referring to the couple’s eldest, North West.

“No more Plan B, Plan A,” he added.

Speaking to a crowd of a couple hundred ticket-holders at the Exquis Event Center in North Charleston, West later backtracked, saying that he believes abortion should be legal, but that financial incentives would discourage the practice.

“Everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars,” he said as an example.

His rambling speech also included a dig at underground railroad hero Harriet Tubman.

“Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slave, she just had the slaves go work for other white people,” West told the crowd.

He also claimed to have a 132 IQ and that: “I went to the hospital because my brain was too big for my skull.”

This was West’s first campaign event since he announced his presidential bid in a July 4th tweet. The billionaire sneaker mogul said he was starting his own party for 2020, “the Birthday Party.”

He appears on the presidential ballot in Oklahoma — after filing the $35,000 filing fee last week — though questions are still swirling over whether he’s actually running.

West needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon Monday to appear on the South Carolina ballot.
