Given the ongoing trend of global urbanization and the impacts of climate change on cities, there is an increased awareness and perception of different positive effects of urban vegetation, e.g. as a local climate adaptation measure (Seto et al., 2011; Rosenzweig et al., 2011; Larsen, 2015). A way to assess positive aspects of urban vegetation is the framework of urban ecosystem services (UESS), i.e. the benefits the urban population receives from ecosystems. This concept is increasingly applied in scientific studies (e.g. Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2013; Luederitz et al., 2015). UESS define provisioning (e.g. food), regulating (climate), supporting (habitat) and cultural (recreation) services of ecosystems or of specific components of ecosystems, i.e. trees, parks or street greenery (Luederitz et al., 2015). 
Green roofs are one specific type of vegetated urban ecosystems (Berardi et al., 2014; Sutton, 2015). The construction of green roofs concerning number and surface area of green roofs has been globally increasing during recent years (e.g. Charpentier, 2015). As an example for Germany, a leader in green roof construction, it is assumed that about 8 million m2 of green roof area are installed annually (FBB, 2015). Green roofs are composed as either extensive or intensive roof vegetation systems (cf. Oberndorfer et al., 2007 for a detailed review). While the former have shallow substrate depths (2–20 cm) and primarily are composed of drought-tolerant sedum vegetation and mosses which require little maintenance, the latter have deeper substrates (>20 cm), are more diverse, not limited to specific plant types, and require regular maintenance and irrigation (Oberndorfer et al., 2007; Pfoser et al., 2014). The implementation of a green roof depends on statical characteristics and on roof slope. Generally, green roofs can be installed at slopes between 0 and 30◦ (FLL, 2008; cf. Section 2.2). 
Green roof ecosystems are characterised to provide a range of UESS, e.g. microclimate regulation, air quality improvement, stormwater retention, habitat for flora and fauna, and aesthetic values (Oberndorfer et al., 2007). The benefits of green roof ecosystems have been intensively reviewed in scientific literature (e.g. Oberndorfer et al., 2007; Rowe, 2011; Sutton, 2015) and will only be briefly summarised at this point. One of the most recognised environmental benefits of green roofs is the capacity for (local) thermal regulation. A couple of studies report a significant decrease of surface and air temperature above green roofs in comparison to conventional roofs (Gaffin et al., 2009; Teemusk and Mander, 2010; Jim and Peng, 2012; Heusinger and Weber, 2015). Additionally, green roofs were studied for their potential to mitigate air pollution (Getter et al., 2009; Rowe, 2011; Speak et al., 2012), and to reduce rainwater runoff (DeNardo et al., 2005; VanWoert et al., 2005; Mentens et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2015). Furthermore, the positive impact for urban biodiversity, e.g. as additional habitat for different animal species, was studied by a couple of researchers (Francis and Lorimer, 2011; Cook-Patton and Bauerle, 2012). These benefits, most of which are also related to other types of urban green infrastructure such as parks, forests or community gardens (Coutts and Hahn, 2015), are of specific importance especially in dense built inner city areas where the implementation of additional green is limited due to space constraints, space competition and regulative aspects. Green roofs, however, can be implemented on roof area already in existence.
