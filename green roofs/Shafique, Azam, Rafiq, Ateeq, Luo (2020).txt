Recently, urbanization is a megatrend around the globe. Continuous urbanization can lead to economic development but also puts enormous pressure on existing infrastructure in cities (Cui and Shi, 2012; Lin and Zhu, 2018). Evidently, excessive urban runoff as a result of enormous urbanization is causing flash flooding and water quality degradation problems (Luo et al., 2018; Samsuri et al., 2018; Muhammad Shafique and Kim, 2017). Moreover, According to (Min et al., 2011) study, climate change is another critical factor, due to which the intensity of rain events will increase in the near future. As a result of this, these extreme rain events will cause a number of problems including flash flooding, water quality degradations, and heatwaves. Under these circumstances, there is a high need for green and sustainable practice which could retrieve the natural hydrology (allowing green spaces like a green roof to allow evapotranspiration) in urban areas. 
According to (Hogan and Walbridge, 2007), the demand for new effective strategies for sustainable stormwater management is increasing i.e. Green Infrastrastrture (GI) (Licata, 2012; M. Shafique and Kim, 2017a; Muhammad Shafique and Kim, 2017) all around the world. This is because GI employs a natural process to collect, treat and improve runoff water quality as compared to conventional infrastructure (which only captures and allows water towards the sewer system) (M. Shafique and Kim, 2017a). Typical examples of GI are green roofs (rooftop vegetation to collect and store rainwater), rain gardens (vegetation on the ground surface to restore and infiltrate rainwater), permeable pavement (pavement with voids to allow infiltration of water) (M. Shafique and Kim, 2017a). 
In urban areas, roof area is approximately 40e50% of the total impervious urban area (Stovin, 2010). This rooftop area gives enormous opportunities to apply green roofs to promote sustainability and a cleaner environment in urban areas (Berardi et al., 2014; Teotonio et al., 2018). Green roofs (GRs) are also called as vegetated roofs are sustainable and effective stormwater management practices which provide multiple benefits including stormwater management (Sangkakool et al., 2018; Shafique et al., 2016b; M. Shafique et al., 2018a; Stovin et al., 2012), reduce heatwaves (Imran et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2013; Shafique et al., 2016a; M. Shafique and Kim, 2017b), energy savings (Berardi, 2016; Cascone et al., 2018) and biodiversity (Berardi et al., 2014; Muhammad Shafique et al., 2018) on the building scale. However, implementations (including materials extraction, production, and transportation of raw materials, construction, operation, maintenance and recycle/decay) of GRs can bring about several environmental and economic burdens (Law et al., 2017). Consequently, the comprehensive assessment of green roofâ€™s environmental and cost benefits should be conducted to provide a sustainable design in the near future. This will help to adopt more safer and sustainable materials for green roofs construction to promote sustainability around the globe.
