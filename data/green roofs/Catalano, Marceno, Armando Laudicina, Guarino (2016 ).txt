Urban sustainability is one of the urgent challenges of the 21st century  (Wu, 2014), since more than 50% of the world’s population live in urban areas, and this figure is estimated to reach 66% by 2050 (UNDESA, 2014). Continuously spreading cities and the growth of intensive agriculture are the major causes of habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide (Grimm et al., 2008). However urban green spaces can play a key role in biodiversity conservation (Goddard, Dougill, & Benton, 2010) and enhance urban ecosystem resilience (Colding, 2007). In particular, green roofs can partially compensate for the loss of green areas by replacing impervious surfaces, contributing to an increase in urban biodiversity (Brenneisen, 2003, 2006). In fact, by replicating specific habitat features and conditions, these artificial biotopes can host native flora and fauna in relatively undisturbed stands where plants, insects and birds can become established (Köhler, 2006; Kadas, 2006; Baumann, 2006). 
The  first known study on the biotic colonisation of green roofs dates back to 1940, when Kreh (1945) listed the plant species colonising some tar-paper-gravel roofs in Stuttgart, Germany. This roofing technique was developed at the beginning of 19th century in Silesia and consisted of a combination of tar and four layers of paper covered by a mixture of gravel and sand (Köhler and Poll, 2010). In Kreh’s study (1945), species were categorised according to the following functional group: bryophytes, CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) species and therophytes, substrate depth preferences (5–20 cm), pollination and dispersal strategies. 
Modern  green roofs can be classified as intensive, extensive and simple-intensive (German guidelines; FLL, 2008). Extensive green roofs consist of a shallow substrate ranging from 6 to 15 cm, planted or sown with drought tolerant plant species, and require low maintenance; intensive green roofs consist of a >20 cm thick substrate (normally top-soil), planted with woody and/or herbaceous species, and generally require irrigation and high maintenance; and simple-intensive green roofs can be seen as an intermediate roof type, consisting of 15–20 cm thick substrate (including top-soil), hosting perennial grasses and tall herbaceous species, and requiring medium maintenance. 
Several  studies of spontaneously colonised tar-paper-gravel, simple-intensive as well as extensive green roofs in central Europe, have described the recurrent plant communities thriving on different depths and kinds of substrate (Darius and Drepper, 1984; Thommen, 1986; Borchardt, 1994). These studies found that on 5–8 cm gravel roofs, stress tolerant species (Sedo-Scleranthetea) are enhanced while greater depths favoured ruderal species (Artemisietea vulgaris and/or Stellarietea mediae) and competitive species (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and Festuco Brometea) (Bornkamm, 1961; Bossler & Suszka, 1988). Moreover, humus accumulation, nutrient supply and water holding capacity were identified as the main environmental drivers for plant establishment and community dynamics over time. Recently, plant functional traits including Grime’s CSR strategies (Grime, 1974, 2001) and life forms, have been used to predict green roof ecosystem services and identify suitable plant species (Nagase and Dunnett, 2010; Lundholm, MacIvor, MacDougall, & Ranalli, 2010; Van Mechelen, Dutoit, Kattge, & Hermy, 2014). 
Despite  the importance of long-term data in providing adequate planning recommendations (Rowe, Getter, & Durhman, 2012), only few studies have examined green roof dynamics for more than a decade (Krüger, 1999; Köhler, 2006; Köhler and Poll, 2010). Köhler & Poll (2010) assessed the effects of growing media on the vegetation quality and species richness of roofs in Berlin over a time span ranging from 13 to 48 years. Krüger (1999, 2001) instead focused on the changes in species composition over 12 years on the roofs of an eco-settlement in Hannover previously investigated by Ackermann and Vahle (1987).
