In recent decades and years , improved recognition of the benefits of green infrastructure has led to an increasing number of cities adopting policies in support of green roofs. German cities started to support green roofs as early as the 1970s (Berardi et al., 2014). For example, in Munich, all suitable flat roofs with a surface area of over 100 m2 have to be ‘greened’; the city of Esslingen subsidizes 50% of the costs for green roofs, and in Darmstadt, building owners receive up to D 5000 if they install a green roof (Getter and Rowe, 2006). In the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, green roofs are required for all newly constructed roofs with a pitch of less than 30◦ (Berardi et al., 2014). In the Austrian capital Vienna, financial support of D 8 – D 25 is granted per square meter of green roof, with an upper limit of D 2200 per project. During seven years of its existence (2003–2010), this policy has resulted in an additional 16,000 m2 of green roofing (at a cost of D 150,000 of public funding1). Chen (2013) reviewed city policies in several Asian and American cities, and found policies and by-laws favoring green roofing in Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, USA and Canada. Despite these developments, green roofs remain a niche technology and are, with a few exceptions, not yet widely dispersed in urban European areas.
Green roofs are in general classified into two major categories ; intensive green roofs and extensive green roofs (Czemiel Berndtsson, 2010). Intensive green roofs are characterized by a rather high thickness of growing media; soil layers usually are thicker than 200 mm, with soil weights exceeding 300 kg/m2 (Berardi et al., 2014). Such deep soil allows for the growing of relatively large plants, and thus provides greater planting flexibility. Roof top gardens and roof gardens require intensive green roofing (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012b; Kosareo and Ries, 2007). Basic maintenance of such roofs includes weeding, fertilizing, and watering of the plants (Czemiel Berndtsson, 2010). Extensive green roofs, on the other hand, are limited to smaller plants such as sedums, small grasses, herbs, flowers and herbaceous plants (Berardi et al., 2014). The thickness of the growing medium is usually below 150 mm (Hakimdavar et al., 2014), with soil weights between 60 and 150 kg/m2 (Berardi et al., 2014). The construction of extensive green roofs is relatively simple; less effort is required in irrigation and maintenance (or may not be necessary at all). Due to their light weight and low level of maintenance, extensive green roofs are popular solutions in cities and are particularly appropriate for large scale rooftops (Hakimdavar et al., 2014; Jungels et al., 2013). 
Green roofs are generally known to be an environmentally friendly product  and an elementary component of sustainable construction (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012b). It has been shown that green roofs have a positive environmental performance in the long-term (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012a) as emissions generated during component manufacturing are offset 13–32 years after installation. There is still some criticism , however, concerning the nature of the materials used. Despite this, green roofs still promise to be a suitable technology in the domain of climate change adaptation and mitigation. Green roofs can also be financially attractive. In particular, extensive green roofs are considered to be a low risk investment since they can entail payback periods below 10 years (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012b).
