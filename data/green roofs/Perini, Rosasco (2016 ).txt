A wide replication of green envelopes can be a good opportunity to improve urban environment conditions, mitigating urban heat island phenomenon (Fioretti et al., 2010; Onishi et al., 2010; Ottelé et al., 2010; Taha, 1997). The possible integration modalities of green elements in architecture are many, with a major or a minor influence on the project conception and on the formal and functional characteristics (Perini, 2013). Vegetated roofs, traditionally widespread in northern Europe, may use different plant species, for both their influence on architectural aesthetic and the microclimatic improvements obtainable (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008; Fioretti et al., 2010). The many products available on the market propose several integrated solutions for proper drainage, waterproofing, and roof protection depending on the vegetation type, such as grass and bigger or smaller shrubs (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012a; Bouvet and Montacchini, 2007). These  are commonly classified in: intensive, semi-intensive and extensive solutions and have different uses, stratigraphy and vegetation (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008). For every type of green roof substrate thickness (given by the plant species used), maintenance, system weight, obtainable microclimatic benefits, influence on architectural aesthetic, costs, and use are different (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012b; Carter and Keeler, 2008). 
Vertical greening systems are made by simple climbing plants, supporting structures for their growth or planter boxes placed at several heights with a shading function; other provide the possibility to cultivate species otherwise not suitable for growing on vertical surfaces, thanks to the disposition of pre-vegetated panels, defined as “living wall systems” (Köhler, 2008; Perini et al., 2012). These systems entail very different initial costs (i.e. in a range of 3–315 D /m2), maintenance (i.e. in a range of 3–27 D /m2/year) and disposal (i.e. in a range of 31–220 D /m2 ) (Perini and Rosasco, 2013). 
Studies conducted on green roofs and vertical greening systems demonstrate that systems provide several benefits, both social and personal (Bianchini and Hewage, 2012b; Perini and Rosasco, 2013). A green roof can reduce the energy demand for heating during winter season thanks to its insulation properties; during summer, vertical and horizontal building surfaces covered by plants improve thermal comfort reducing the energy demand for air conditioning (Alexandri and Jones, 2008; Kosareo and Ries, 2007; Perini et al., 2011). 
Permpituck and Namprakai (2012) show that green roofs (10 cm and 20 cm substrate thickness) compared to a bare roof reduce the heat transfer (respectively by 59% and 96%) and energy consumption (respectively by 31% and 37%). Similar studies demonstrate that green roofs also reduce the heat flow between 51% and 63% (Morau et al., 2011). During summer a wet green roof can increase the heat dissipation through evapo-transpiratory cooling, reducing the energy demand for air conditioning (Barrio, 1998). With high solar radiation (1400 W/m2 ), a surface temperature differs between a bare roof and a soil roof under a dense vegetation layer by up to 31,4 ◦ C (Wong et al., 2003). 
Studies demonstrate that a vertical green layer can contribute to the building envelope performances by creating an extra stagnant air layer, which has an insulating effect (Perini et al., 2011), and reducing the energy demand for air-conditioning up to 40–60% in Mediterranean climate (Alexandri and Jones, 2008; Mazzali et al., 2012). 
Another relevant benefit of green roof systems regards stormwater management, with a reduction in stormwater runoff in a range of 60%–100%, depending on system’s characteristics, and climatic conditions (Hashemi et al., 2015; Nawaz et al., 2015; Wong and Jim, 2014), while improving also water quality (Vijayaraghavan and Joshi, 2015; Vijayaraghavan et al., 2012). 
Vegetation and other layers of green roofs or vertical greening systems can increase the roof longevity from 20 to 40 years (Clark et al., 2005). Studies demonstrate that green roofs and plants along a facade improve also the aesthetic of a building and its real estate value (Franc ̧ ois et al., 2002; Gao and Asami, 2007; Peck et al., 1999). An intensive or extensive green roof is similar to a green area: Peck et al. (1999) demonstrate that the real estate value of a building can increase from 6 to 15% with the presence of a green roof or green wall. 
Studies investigated also the relation between worker productivity and the presence of vegetation: employees in office buildings who had view on green area (garden, etc.) increase their productivity (Kaplan et al., 1988). 
Greening systems in dense urban areas provide relevant social benefits, mainly related to air quality improvement, also due to lower greenhouse gas output production, mitigation of urban heat island (UHI) effect, improvement of urban wildlife and plant species biodiversity, increasing also the quality of urban space (Dunnett and Kingsbury, 2008; Goddard et al., 2010; Onishi et al., 2010). 
Vegetation improves air quality: gaseous pollutants can be dissolved or sequestrated through stomata on plants and leaves (McPherson et al., 1994). Tan and Sia (Tan and Sia, 2005) sampled roof temperatures and other air quality parameters both pre and post green roof installation in Singapore; using light sensors, volume aerosol samplers and particle counters they found that acid gaseous pollutants, carbon mass levels and ambient green roof surface temperature dropped significantly after the installation of green roofs. A green roof located in the urban dense area of Chicago can absorb up to 52% of O3, 27% of NO2, 14% of PM10 and 7% of SO2 (Yang et al., 2008). 
High levels of pollution in the atmosphere and the “cementification” of urban cause the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, resulting in the dramatic two to five degree Celsius temperature difference between cities and their surrounding suburban and rural areas (Taha, 1997). Though the UHI phenomenon has regional-scale impacts on energy demand, air quality, and public health, mitigation strategies, such as urban forestry, living (green) roofs, and light colored surfaces, could be implemented at the community level (Rosenzweig et al., 2006). Although UHI can be mitigated with large amount of surfaces with higher albedo (e.g. green areas) (Rizwan et al., 2008), larger green areas like urban parks may be more effective (Petralli et al., 2006). Akbari (2005) shows that the mitigation of the urban heat island effect with trees, green roofs and green facades can reduce the U.S. national energy consumption for air conditioning up to 20%, saving of more than $10 billion per year in energy costs. 
The economic sustainability of green roofs has been investigated by several authors. Wong et al. (2003) evaluate the economic sustainability of intensive and extensive green roofs and demonstrate that only extensive green roofs are economically sustainable, due to higher installation and maintenance costs for intensive green roofs. 
Bianchini and Hewage (2012b) evaluated, by means of a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), the economic sustainability of intensive and extensive green roofs, demonstrating that both are economically sustainable from social and personal point of view (respectively Net Present Value – NPV of 3606 $/m2 and 5715 $/m2); in their case study the two authors considered a tax incentive of 48 $/m2; so the financial risk for installing any green roofs type is very low. Other studies (Carter and Keeler, 2008; Clark et al., 2008) show the economic sustainability of green roofs compared to traditional roofs calculating the NPV by means of CBA. In a case study located in Flanders, Claus and Rousseau (2012) discovered that an extensive green roof in Flanders is economically sustainable in two case scenarios (base and best, with public subsidies). In the worst scenario or without subsidies, the systems analysed are not economically sustainable. 
A study conducted by Perini and Rosasco (2013) demonstrates that in an ordinary scenario of cost and benefit values a direct green facade with a well grown Hedera helix and an indirect green facade with the vegetation supported by a plastic mesh can be economically sustainable, due to the low installation and maintenance costs during a life span of 50 years. For the other systems analysed (indirect green facade with planter box with steel mesh and living wall system) economic indicators show that they are not sustainable even in a best case scenario. The authors suggest that the economic sustainability of such systems can be significantly increased by reducing the initial costs for promoters; this can be achieved through government incentives. For example, the city of New York enhanced installation of green roofs allowing one-time tax abatement of 48,50 $/m2 (up to $100,000 or the building’s tax liability, whichever is less) wherever the green roof covered at least 50% of the total roof area (NYC Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC), 2015).
